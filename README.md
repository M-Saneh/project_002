Introduction:
Welcome to the Snake Water Gun Game! This is a fun, command-line game written in Python. It's a twist on the classic "Rock Paper Scissors" game, where you get to play against the computer.

The rules are simple:

Snake drinks Water (so Snake wins).
Water douses the Gun (Water wins).
Gun shoots the Snake (Gun wins).
If you and the computer both pick the same option, it’s a tie!

How to Play
Snake beats Water.
Water beats Gun.
Gun beats Snake.
If both choices are the same, it’s a draw!
